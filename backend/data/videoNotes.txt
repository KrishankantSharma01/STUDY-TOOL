### Part 1: Oligopoly Characteristics and the Kinked Demand Curve

Characteristics of Oligopoly
-   Definition: An oligopoly is a market dominated by a few firms, indicated by a high concentration ratio (typically, no more than seven firms holding about 70% market share).
-   Barriers to Entry: These markets feature high barriers to entry and exit, such as strong brand loyalty, sunk costs, economies of scale, and high startup costs.
-   Product Differentiation: Firms are price makers because they sell differentiated, unique goods.
-   Interdependence: This is the defining feature; firms do not make decisions independently but act based on the actions and reactions of their rivals.
-   Objectives: Due to interdependence, profit maximization is not always the sole objective; firms engage in a "dog fight" for market share and will pursue whatever objective secures market power.
-   Competition Style: Because prices tend to be rigid, competition often focuses on non-price factors like branding, advertising, and quality.
-   Real-World Examples:
    -   Global: Soft drinks (Coca-Cola and Pepsi duopoly), the car industry, and OPEC (petroleum).
    -   UK: Supermarkets, energy industry, bus market, and short-haul/long-haul airlines.

The Kinked Demand Curve Model
This model illustrates interdependence and explains price rigidity (sticky prices) in two ways.

-   Logic of the Kink (Why firms don't change prices):
    -   The market price settles at P1, and the demand curve has different elasticities above and below this point.
    -   Raising Price (Above P1): Demand is price elastic. If a firm raises prices, rivals will not follow; they will keep prices low to gain market share. Consequently, the firm raising prices suffers a significant drop in demand and total revenue.
    -   Lowering Price (Below P1): Demand is price inelastic. If a firm lowers prices, rivals will follow to protect their market share, leading to a price war. Demand increases proportionately less than the price cut, causing total revenue to fall without gaining market share in the long run.
    -   Conclusion: It makes no sense to raise or lower prices from P1, creating price rigidity.

-   The Marginal Revenue (MR) Curve (Vertical Gap):
    -   In this model, the MR curve has a vertical gap at the point of the kink.
    -   If marginal costs (MC) change (e.g., increase from MC1 to MC2) but stay within this vertical gap, a profit-maximizing firm (producing where MC=MR) will not change its quantity or price.
    -   This provides a theoretical explanation for why firms do not need to change prices even when costs fluctuate.

Conclusions from the Kinked Demand Model
-   Price Wars: Despite the theory suggesting rigidity, price competition (price wars) does occur in reality, such as among UK supermarkets or short-haul airlines.
-   Non-Price Competition: Because prices remain sticky at P1, it is logical for firms to compete heavily on branding and quality.
-   Collusion: Interdependence is frustrating, creating a strong temptation for firms to collude, fix prices like a monopoly, and earn high profits rather than worrying about rivals' reactions.

### Part 2: Oligopoly and Game Theory

Overview
Game Theory is used to map interdependence in greater detail than the Kinked Demand Curve, often utilizing the Prisoner's Dilemma model.

The Payoff Matrix (The Setup)
-   The model visualizes two firms (Firm A and Firm B) facing pricing decisions: charging a High Price (£1) or a Low Price (90p).
-   The matrix shows profits (payoffs) for each combination of choices, where the left number in a cell is Firm A's profit and the right number is Firm B's profit.

Solving the Game (Rational Behavior)
-   Scenario for Firm A:
    -   If Firm B charges a High Price (£1), Firm A should undercut and charge a Low Price (90p) to earn £4 million rather than £3 million.
    -   If Firm B charges a Low Price (90p), Firm A should also charge a Low Price to earn £1 million rather than £0.5 million.
    -   Result: Undercutting/charging the low price is the rational strategy.
-   Scenario for Firm B:
    -   Firm B faces the same incentives; if Firm A charges High, B undercuts to earn £4 million. If Firm A charges Low, B matches to earn £1 million.
-   Nash Equilibrium: The game settles where both firms charge the Low Price (90p) and earn £1 million each. This is the only stable outcome where both firms have made their rational choice based on the other's action.
-   Dominant Strategy: For both firms, charging the low price (90p) is the dominant strategy regardless of what the rival does.

Conclusions from Game Theory
1.  Price Rigidity: Because the Nash Equilibrium (Low Price/Low Price) is the stable outcome, prices will remain rigid at 90p, and competition will shift to non-price factors.
2.  Temptation to Collude: The Nash Equilibrium is not the best joint outcome. If both firms cooperated to charge the High Price (£1), they would each earn £3 million instead of £1 million. This creates a massive incentive to break interdependence, form a cartel, and fix prices.
3.  Incentive to Cheat: Even if firms agree to collude (charge £1), the incentive to "cheat" remains strong. A firm can earn £4 million by undercutting the cartel agreement. Therefore, collusion and cartels are often unstable in the long run because firms are tempted to undercut rivals for higher individual profit.
